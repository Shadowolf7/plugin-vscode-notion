## What are we doing?

### The problem

- People loose focus while programming
- People don't know what influences their productivity
- People associate time spent coding and number of lines written as the only metrics for producitivity
- People want to build on top of Notion and need a seed/starting point
- Notion needs a way to convey your current brain state

So, there are lot's of needs to align notion with developers and even if someone get's a notion, wears it and is near wifi, they still can't get a daily utility out of Notion

### The solution

The VSCode extension will:

- Provide a simple out of the box experience for developers
- Firebase + Custom Metric Subscriber
- Event-driven multi-client real-time architecture

Using NotionJS allows you, the user, to quickly integrate Notion so you can begin investing in yourself by hacking your life.

## Who are we?

Mainly, we are Neurosity. [AJ Keller][link_aj_twitter] started this project to boost his productitiy. We seek to open source this application as _seed_ to bloosum into dozens of applications. API portion of Notion such that the community at large can begin to improve the interface between applications and Notion. If we can write applications better, then the world improves.

## What do we need?

**You**! In whatever way you can help.

We need expertise in programming, user experience, software sustainability, documentation and technical writing and project management.

We'd love your feedback along the way.
